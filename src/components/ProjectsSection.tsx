      description: "Configured ArduPilot firmware for fixed-wing aircraft. Integrated motors, ESCs, servos, IMU, GPS, and telemetry systems with PID tuning.",
      longDescription: "Hands-on work was conducted on a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft system with a focus on firmware configuration, avionics integration, and flight validation. ArduPilot firmware was customized for the aircraft, and motors, ESCs, servos, IMU, GPS, telemetry radios, and onboard avionics were wired and integrated to ensure reliable power distribution and signal integrity. RC transmitter inputs were mapped and validated, PID tuning was supported, and both ground and flight testing were carried out to evaluate stability, control response, and overall system performance. This work provided practical experience in embedded flight-control systems, sensor integration, and real-world debugging in safety-critical aerospace robotics environments.",

      longDescription: "Hands-on engineering work was performed on multiple electric vehicle subsystems with a focus on embedded electronics, firmware, and PCB redesign. The vehicle architecture was upgraded by migrating from an ATmega16M1 to an STM32G441KBT6 microcontroller across the Charging Board, BMS Core, and Power Distribution Unit. Schematics were fully redrawn in KiCad, with updated footprints, pin mappings, and electrical connections, and PCB layouts were revised to support new routing, power stages, and interfaces. Existing firmware was modified to run on the STM32, including updates to pin definitions, peripherals, CAN communication, and I/O behavior. Board bring-up and systematic debugging were conducted to validate correct operation and subsystem reliability.",

      longDescription: "Hands-on development was carried out on an autonomous mobile robot designed for indoor navigation and object collection. The system was built using ROS2 and implemented SLAM and Nav2 for localization, mapping, and autonomous path planning. Simulation and validation were performed in Gazebo and RViz prior to physical deployment. Hardware and software components were integrated to enable reliable navigation and task execution in a dynamic environment. This project provided experience in autonomous robotics software stacks, simulation-driven development, and system-level debugging.",

      longDescription: "An AI-based fall detection system was designed and implemented to improve safety monitoring in elderly care scenarios. The system combined computer vision and sequence modeling to analyze human motion patterns, using OpenCV and MediaPipe for pose extraction and an LSTM-based model to classify falls versus normal activities. A custom dataset of fall and non-fall scenarios was collected and processed to train and evaluate the model. The solution was optimized for real-time performance and demonstrated reliable detection in practical conditions. This project was recognized as the winner of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge, highlighting its technical merit and real-world impact.",
